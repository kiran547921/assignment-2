        <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>

        <p>"1 was an EMT for many years before 1 joined the bootcamp. Ive been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 1 signed up for the tree intro course and found it incred ibly funl t enroled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup</p>

        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile-team project. 6 particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, [ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</p>
